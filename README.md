# 🎥 Video Summarization Using Object Detection

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on summarizing long videos by automatically detecting meaningful frames using object detection techniques. Instead of manually watching entire videos, this system extracts only important segments based on detected objects, reducing time and improving efficiency.

The goal is to generate a short, meaningful video summary while preserving key moments and context.

## 📁 Project Workflow
1. Load and preprocess video input  
2. Apply object detection model frame-by-frame  
3. Filter and select frames with detected objects  
4. Compile selected frames into summarized output video  
5. Export final summarized video
